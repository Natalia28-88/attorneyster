# Responsive Website for a Law Firm

This project is a full-fledged frontend application built with ReactJS, based on a landing page design. The design was slightly modified and split into multiple pages, each with its own functionality, including:

- Filtering
- Search
- Sorting
- Form submission with validation (using EmailJS and the useForm hook)

Some data is loaded onto a mockApi server, and backend requests are made using the axios library. Lazy Loading is used to optimize the application.

The code is written in TypeScript. Global state management is handled using Redux Toolkit. Navigation across the site without page reloads is managed with React Router v6. Styling is done with SCSS combined with CSS modules, and code readability is maintained using the Visual Studio Code Prettier extension.
