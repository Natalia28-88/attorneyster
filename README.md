# ⚖️ Attorneyster — Responsive Website for a Law Firm

This is a frontend application built with **ReactJS** and **TypeScript**, developed as an educational project.
The design was originally taken from a landing page mockup.

---

## 📝 Project Description

> My goal was to practice advanced React development by turning a simple landing into a functional **multi-page application**, adding dynamic features like:

- 🔎 Filtering, searching, sorting
- ✅ Form submission with validation (EmailJS + useForm)
- 📊 Mock API integration (axios requests)
- 💤 Lazy Loading optimization

It was an opportunity to consolidate my knowledge of **React, TypeScript, Redux Toolkit, React Router v6**, and modern frontend architecture.

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **ReactJS 18** (Hooks, Code Splitting)
- **TypeScript**
- **Redux Toolkit** (state management)
- **React Router v6** (SPA navigation)
- **Axios** (data fetching)
- **MockAPI** (test backend)
- **SCSS + CSS Modules** (styling)
- **EmailJS** (form submission)
- **Prettier** (code formatting)

### ✨ Why it's worth showcasing:

> "Not just a layout, but a **functional application** with React state management, dynamic data, form handling, and SPA routing. Great example of taking a static design to a working app."
